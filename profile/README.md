### Organisational overview

The purpose is to promote collaboration and connection between worlds

This is a way to discover hidden gems and everyday tools that are hiding elsewhere

Even some CVS archives have been mirrored here. Most notably and by far most complicated Cygwin. Windows in the constellation Cygnus. Everyone that has tried to use Windows know how hard it can be without the proper tools

Code search is one of the strong points of this lab and even on the phone it's relatively easy and fast to find code segments inside large projects. One reason for a mirror, or a copy, here also. Or just from laziness in creating a patch quickly without bothering about remember the login to the right lab or official lab where they usually work on the project 

### Maintenance and contacts

If you own a project and wish to add it, remove it, move it, change ownership, or hide it from this project or this lab the best way to contact us is with a public message under Issues or Discussion inside the maintenance project mirror/mirror. And be patient for a reply it will come in due time. If it is urgent you can try contacting the current and public organisation members directly
